# Real: Parent repo for Real projects

This is a very small repo that sets up CMake, formatting and linting for Real projects. Real projects should be cloned as direct subdirectories.

This is used, for example, by [RealEngine](https://github.com/ZADNE/RealEngine) and [RealWorld](https://github.com/ZADNE/RealWorld).
